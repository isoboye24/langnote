Your words can be seen by you alone unless you share your account with someone else. Many services have built online dictionary, but in our opinion, none found the right compromise of ownership, flexibility and safety."

Having sacrificed your time learning for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years or more, with some textbooks and notebooks and you search for words or phrases or sentences in any of the notebooks that you wrote down with your personal explanations. Searching for such will consume your time most especially when you can't remember the exact page or your notebook is not by your side."
